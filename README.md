# Alternate Block Designs
## What This Mod Is

This mod is a curated set of block variants that Mojang has left out of the vanilla game.

## What This Mod Is Not

This mod is not an exhaustive set of all alternate block types for all vanilla materials.
This is my take on adding block variants that I feel belong in the base game, and are based on the existing choices that Mojang have made for the current block set.

## New for v1.1.0

- Added Red Nether Brick item
  - Old Red Nether Bricks recipe now gives 4 Red Nether Brick
- Added Red Nether Brick Fence, Red Nether Brick Fence Gate
- Added Stonecutter recipes for all Concrete and Terracotta block variants
- Updated Nether Brick Fence Gate to create 2 items instead of 1 to match vanilla Nether Brick Fence recipe

## Known Issues

- Nether Brick Fence Gate, Red Nether Brick Fence Gate, and Brick Fence Gate use the wrong sounds, using all standard Wood sounds.
There are no existing non-wood gate opening or closing sounds.
  - Fun Fact: The vanilla codebase hard codes a requirement for all Fence Gates to have an associated WoodType.

## Future Considerations

There are currently only a couple of features planned for a future update.

- Glazed Terracotta Slabs
- Copper Fence and Copper Fence Gate
- Correct block hit and break sounds for Brick and Nether Brick Fence Gates
- Add a brick type sound for Nether Brick and Brick Fence Gates
