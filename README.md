# Alternate Block Designs
## What This Mod Is
This mod is a curated set of block variants that Mojang has left out of the vanilla game. 
There are no new textures included in this mod.

## What This Mod Is Not
This mod is not an exhaustive set of all alternate block types for all vanilla materials.
This is my take on adding block variants that I feel belong in the base game, and are based on the existing choices that Mojang have made for the current block set.

## Current Block Variant List
Below is a list of all variant blocks included in the mod.

### Wood Types

## Known Issues

- Nether Brick Fence Gate and Brick Fence Gate use the wrong sounds, using all standard Wood sounds.
There are no existing non-wood gate opening or closing sounds.
  - Fun Fact: The vanilla codebase hard codes a requirement for all Fence Gates to have an associated WoodType.

## Future Considerations

There are currently only a couple of features planned for a future update.

- Glazed Terracotta Slabs
- Red Nether Brick Fence and Fence Gate
  - Revamp of Red Nether Brick recipes to add a Red Nether Brick item to match the existing Nether Brick, and various Nether Brick block variants
- Copper Fence and Copper Fence Gate
- Correct block hit and break sounds for Brick and Nether Brick Fence Gates
- Add a brick type sound for Nether Brick and Brick Fence Gates
